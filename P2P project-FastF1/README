#  P2P FastF1 â€“ Analysis of Driving and Other Attributes Among Friends

This project explores Formula 1 racing data using the [FastF1 API](https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1) in a **peer-to-peer** environment. The goal is to fetch race telemetry, analyze performance metrics (like lap times, top speed, tire strategy), and share them with friends over a P2P network for collaborative comparison.

---

## Features

- Fetch race and driver data from the FastF1 API
- Extract lap times, sector data, and strategy insights
- Store and retrieve data using MongoDB or SQLite
- Peer-to-peer data sharing using sockets or REST API
- Compare driving stats among friends
- Optional: Visualize stats using matplotlib or plotly

#Project Overview

This project simulates a friendly leaderboard where users compare driving attributes from real F1 sessions. The application uses modular scripts to:
- Fetch and preprocess FastF1 data
- Store it in a local database
- Share it with other users (peers)
- Analyze and visualize performance
